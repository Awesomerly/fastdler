# fastdler
Random script to mirror/compress a directory. This is very very jank. I can only do what I can do.

## install
You can install this program directly with pipx:
`pipx install git+https://github.com/Awesomerly/fastdler`

This uses PDM for development so it's possible to `pdm install` then `pdm run fastdler <args>` I think?

## run
`fastdler <source directory> <destination directory>`
